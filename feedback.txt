A few things right off the bat:

- I like what you went for with the light bulb, but it is very distracting and I don't quite understand the point of it. Why not just use a simple icon to toggle dark mode?

- Your smaller heading text and paragraph text on dark mode have poor contrast. Use plain white text for them. 

- Your skillset icons take up too much space on desktop.

- CS50 is not a skill

- I would suggest taking your projects and turning them into smaller cards, with the tech you used to build them and a 2 line summary of them right on the card, rather than having to toggle a modal to see that.
